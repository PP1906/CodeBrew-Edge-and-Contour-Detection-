Edges: Edges is actually the analysis of the discontinues in the images. Usually edges are found or occur on the boundary of two objects


Contours: Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity.

Canny Edge Detection
The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986.



Steps involoved in Canny Edge Detection:
The process of Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down to five different steps:

1. Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise
2. Find the intensity gradients of the image
3. Apply gradient magnitude thresholding or lower bound cut-off suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection
4. Apply double threshold to determine potential edges
5. Track edge by hysteresis: Finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges.




In this project we will use the tools provided with opencv to do all these steps faster.
